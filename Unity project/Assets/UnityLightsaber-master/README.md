UnityLightsaber - Volumetric Lightsaber in Unity.

I spent a few weeks putting this Lightsaber together for Unity. The asset store won't host it because of copyright issues, so now it's freely available on GitHub!

The blade is fully volumetric, with a nice rim shader. The glow is almost volumetric except when the weapon is pointed right at the camera. Still need to figure that one out.
